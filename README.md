# RaspberryPi-FullStack
The code from the course Raspberry Pi:Full Stack
I am learning how to use the RPi for embedded systems.
This course has been great.
I was trying to find the fix for the Google Charts zero-referenced month bug
and happened to clone the repository in the process.
I have found the -1 fix so mission accomplished.
Sorry about generating another fork.  Don't know much about Github but I am learning as I go.
